Events with the least attendance:

The individual campus visit had the most participants with a   31.65% attendance. Meanwhile corporate training and women who dare had the least participants with only 0.46% and 0.92% attendance respectively. Other popular events included the open house, on-campus information session, and information sessions at high school.

##### 2. What is the gender ratio among the different courses?

For each course, men made up the majority of the classes (>50%). Intro to IT had the highest percentage of males and least percentage of females, 88.89% and 11.11% respectively. Meanwhile, Internet & Web Page Design had the highest percentage of women at 29.17%, but the course was still dominated by males. Additionally, non-binary overall had the least enrollment in these courses.

##### Insights:

- This information is useful because the events with the least participation can be changed/improved or cancelled. It also informs the department about which events there should be more of.
- Additionally, this information can be used to increase diversity within IT related degree programs.

## Selected Population Discoveries

##### Population: Females under the age of 25

### Only non-IT related majors responded to the question: On a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being not at all interested and 5 being extremely interested, how interested are you in taking more computing classes?

Engineering majors expressed the most interest.
